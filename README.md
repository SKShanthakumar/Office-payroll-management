# Office Payroll Management

The Office Payroll Management Project is a Python application built using the tkinter module for the graphical user interface and Excel CSV files for data storage. This project is designed to streamline and automate the payroll management process for an office. It allows you to easily view, add, modify, and delete employee records, calculate salaries, generate payroll reports, and export data in CSV format.

You can directly use this program by adding the python file and csv file in same location.
